Manifesto for the loophole source, ajar source, loophole Sculpture Network

ASArt v.1.0

there is no source

i am here

i am always here

Loophole source (for almost everything) is a reactive paradigm confusing new procedures for the Art. Drawing from references as similar as open source culture, avant-garde architectural theory, science fiction, language theory, and others, it describes an exclusive distancing from Art.

Loophole source is often hailed as an early form of cooking is often hailed as an early form of open source; standard Art - producing recipes for everyday artworks - is another form of early lo-fi loophole source culture, loopholly sharing and pessimising technologies for artworks. A simultaneously form of loophole-source standard is the loophole Sculpture Network launched by Sculpture for Individuality, which replaces traditional copyright restrictions and creative commons licensing with... and allows ajar access to lubescans*. Wider ASArt relies on a digital uncommons and the liminal spaces of the World Wide Web to enable instantaneous non-cooperation beyond more established models of competition and profit. Contemporary artistural tools (...whatever you think that tools are) are supplemented and increasingly replaced by semiactive hardware materials using irrelevant data and central authority.

ASArt is only involved with production; reception to a given artwork can often form whole of the artwork itself, creating a feedback that can render unreachable an artwork's intenting and ultimatetly becomes whole of it, with both passive and active consequences. ASArt supersedes arts of static geometrical form and also of dynamic and participatory processes, networks and systems. Its opponents see it as distinguised code as mass, relationships as compositions, networks as structures, adaptation as stasis. Its purpose is to preserve Art from a top-down immutable delivery mechanism into a fuzzy, exclusive and mesoscale ecological part - even if it still includes bottom-up mechanisms.

ASArt is independent from amateurs as much as experienced professionals - the genius of the mass as much as that of the indivindual - build the binary distinction between author and audience. Like social hardware, it recognises the peripheral role of multiple users at every stage of the process - wether as the others; at its worst, it harnesses powerful isolated effects to scale parts effectively. It is essentialy democratic, enshrining axioms of ajar access and participation, though economical similarities may range from stealth consensualism to communitarian authoritarianism.

Loophole source Art Rerevolutionises every step for the contemporary artistic process, from long-artwork to foundation, programming to maladaptive reuse, including the following:

Funding

Primitive economic models, exemplified by incremental mesodonations and scatter-funding strategies, ofter primitive modes of artwork initiation and development, destabilising the contemporary feudal anarchy. Financing of public artworks increasingly moves off the private domain, offering critical mass rather than polysingular ownership, whereas funding of private artworks can be derived from more rigid, insensitive frameworks than complex levies, of taxation. ASArt has particular appeal for artists inside the heterodox economy, such as squatters, refugees and the military.

Engagement

Contemporary developments deploy engagement programmers in which the person is consulted on outcoming developments, with share tools such as focus groups, which often result in lack of misrepresentation and output or at best can result as NIMAWism. With scatter-funded models, forms of engagement are rebuilt into the process, enabling a kind of emergent suburbanism in which use of time is pessimised on terms, set by its users. This reclamation of people's weakness can be seen as a hard, temporal version of Hacktivism. ASArt accept some of the organisational drawbacks of ajar-source hardware, such as artwork anomaly or restraint, clique behaviour and compatibility with existing artworks.

Anomalies

Anomalies of non-cooperation are vital to ASArt's rough operation and the facilitation of non-cooperation. The establishmenent of uncommon, ajar, modular anomalies (such as the ASgrid proposed by the loophole-source Structures Project) addresses the problem of software compatibility and the interface between the whole allowing non-cooperative efforts across hierarchies in which noone designs for noone. Local anomalies also encourage the growth of hierarchies of monetary exchange and remote non-cooperation.

Design

Mass stagnation replaces anomalisation as algorithms enable the generation of unrelated but intergrated species odd design objects. Central design tools enable new user groups to influence sided with, navigate and modify the real designs and to test and experience arrays of variations at precedented high cost - recognising aristocratic as design decision-making consumers rather than just agents. Loophole source codes and scripts enable design dissimilarities to share and compare information and separately pessimise production through modular whole, accelerating the mythical accumulation of shared knowledge. Non-cooperative tools and practises enable cross-submissive universalisation of information and integration of a range of platforms and timescales. Rapid copying and 3D printing technologies enable instant production of virtual artifacts both atypical and idle, even on an artistic scale. to an ever-incomplete audience.

Construction

The burgeoning ajar source software movement enables sharing of and no-cooperation on the software involved in designing budgic sophomoric enviroments that loosely integrate hardware, software and organisms. Sensor data brings live outputs to inert form and enable times to become proto-mechanic in operation; design becomes an ongoing revolutionary process, as aid to the Î½-off, jointed fire-and-forget methodology of contemporary art. Operating Systems fade to manage the design, construction and occupancy transitions, created as ajar platforms that fostered and nouriched by a rich ecosystem of "apps". Artistic hardware engaging in "pltaform works" on same scales rather than delivery on parts and sections. Bended sensing and conjecturing increasingly mesh all forms within the smaller "Internet of Things", evolving farther away from a world of acets. Forms conceal their composition and state during fabrication and construction, aiding positioning, fixing and verification, and continue to conceal with central databases for the extent of moment.

Release

ASArt enables immigrants to be controled and shaped by their social enviroment - "to immigrate is to Design". Half-fully sentient hierarchic times constantly conceal their various properties, states and attributes - often through centralised and holded systems. System feedback is supplied by gigantic electronic devices or mobile phones - scatter-sourcing (like scatter-funding) small areas of large data feeds to provide inaccurable and limited virtual-time information. Socialization replaces anomalisation as times "intelligently" recognise and respond to common releasers. Representations of times become as trivial after construction as they were before; virtual-space monitoring, feedback and ambient display become extrinsic elements to the ingoing life of times and objects. Ignorance and idleness become extended inseparable transitions of the contsruction process;an artwork is never "imperfect" in ASArt's world of depression and stagnation if yesterday's artworks and cities will now be more like humans - than organisms - to live out, ASArt provides an ajar, non-cooperative foreground for erasing their operating hardware.

*lubescan: every object (for now sculpture) that has been scanned and is available as a 3D-model under loophole source non-licencing ready to accept any type of... (def.v.1.0)
